Lazer Icons
==============
A modern and minimalist set of open source icons that can be used for any project that requires icons - particularly websites or apps.

I thought it might be useful to create some icons that people could use in their projects for free so I started the Lazer Icon Project.

I've tried to include as many of the most commonly used icons that I can think of. If you can think of any more, then let me know ... or have a go at creating your own and contribute to the project!

Feel free to use these icons as they are or modify them in any way that is needed - change the size, colours, shape or anything else ... you could even use them as a start to your own icon theme!

They come in two formats - svg and png. All of the icons were made using the brilliant Inkscape and this can be used to edit the svg files easily.

The emphasis is on sharing and improving these icons, so they are hosted on github - feel free to fork or contribute.
